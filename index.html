        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>[=MiniApp=] is a concept of light software application, that can be distributed through any digital means, and accessed through the Web. MiniApps are defined by a concrete file structure and all their resources are packed within a single file that represents the whole [=MiniApp Package=] that can be processed and executed by [=MiniApp User Agents=].</p>
            <p>A [=MiniApp Package=] contains a directory structure that holds the specific resources of the MiniApp that defines the rendering, operation, and interaction with the end-users — including static page templates, stylesheets, JavaScript documents, media files, and other resources — and the manifest. The [=MiniApp Manifest=], located in the central directory of the package, describes the MiniApp, including information about page routing, styles, and other operational and rendering details of the MiniApp, as well as descriptive information for humans.</p>
            <p>As defined in <a href="#sec-security-privacy">Security and Privacy Considerations</a>, MiniApps MAY support [=digital signature=] verification to guarantee the integrity of the package and contents during the delivery of the package.</p>
            <p>The MiniApp runtime environment ([=MiniApp User Agent=]) identifies MiniApp package files through the standard [=MiniApp Package=] format and the specific MIME media type, defined in this document. After retrieving the [=MiniApp ZIP Container=], the [=MiniApp User Agent=] loads the static page templates, CSS, JavaScript files, and other resources into the cache, following a <a href="#sec-miniapp-processing">dereference and processing algorithm</a>. These [=MiniApp Resources=] will remain available in the cache until the next update, avoiding unnecessary network fetches.</p>
            <p>In terms of launch mode, a MiniApp can be launched normally when offline. The [=MiniApp User Agent=] locates the specified [=start page=] from the package cache path and launches the MiniApp according to the description set out in the [=manifest=] file.</p>

            <h3>Directory and File System Structure</h3>
            <p>The MiniApp Package has a file structure with some restrictions and reserved files and subdirectories.</p> 
            <p>The following example shows a typical file system structure:</p>
            <pre class="example" title="File sytem structure">

                <h3>Root Directory</h3>
                <p>The [=Root Directory=] of a [=MiniApp Package=] holds several reserved files that include global data and information about the lifecycle management of the MiniApp, including:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><code>manifest.json</code></dt>
                    <dd>The [=MiniApp Manifest=] is a JSON document responsible for the global configuration of the MiniApp. A manifest file contains a collection of mandatory and optional attributes that indicate the setup of the MiniApp, including routes and paths of the pages and the window configuration of the MiniApp (e.g., styles of the navigation bar, background image and color, page title, among other), according to the MiniApp Manifest specification [[MINIAPP_MANIFEST]].</dd>
                    <dt><code>app.css</code></dt>
                    <dd>This file is the default CSS stylesheet, responsible for the global appearance of the [=MiniApp pages=]. It MAY be empty.</dd>
                    <dt><code>app.js</code></dt>
                    <dd>This script document has the basic service logic of the MiniApp and includes the basic control of the MiniApp lifecycle, including the management of events for launch, showing and hiding the  MiniApp.</dd>
                </dl>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><code>pages</code> Directory</h3>
                <p>The <code>pages</code> directory contains a set of files for the display and user interaction of the [=MiniApp Pages=].</p>
                <p>A [=MiniApp Page=] is defined by a set of [=resources=], whose files are identified by the file name (e.g., <code>intro</code>) and a specific extension that defines the type [=resource=], such as the service logic (e.g., <code>intro.js</code>), the configuration (e.g., <code>intro.json</code>), the structure (e.g., <code>intro.xml</code>) and the scoped stylesheet (e.g., <code>intro.css</code>).</p>
                <p>Developers MAY choose to store all the files related to a page either under the <code>pages</code> directory or organized in specific sub-directories for each page.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <code>.json</code> file is responsible for the configuration of a MiniApp page. The syntax and structure of these types of files are defined in the <a href="#sec-miniapp-resources-json">JSON Resources</a> section.</li>
                    <li>A <code>.xml</code> file is responsible for the structure of a MiniApp page, similar to HTML. The syntax and structure of these types of files are defined in the <a href="#sec-miniapp-resources-xml">XML Resources</a> section.</li>
                    <li>A <code>.css</code> file is responsible for the CSS style of a MiniApp page. The syntax and structure of these types of files are defined in the <a href="#sec-miniapp-resources-css">CSS Resources</a> section.</li>
                    <li>A <code>.js</code> file is responsible for the service logic and lifecycle management (defined in MiniApp Lifecycle [[MINIAPP_LIFECYCLE]]) of a MiniApp page. The syntax and structure of these types of files are defined in the <a href="#sec-miniapp-resources-js">Scripting Resources</a> section.</li>

                <li>A developer that shares a MiniApp with the <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> department for testing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A [=MiniApp ZIP Container=] contains all the resources that conforms a MiniApp, according to the [=MiniApp Package=] structure in a single file. This format supports the

                <li>MiniApp ZIP Containers MUST NOT use the features in the ZIP application note [[ZIP]] that allow ZIP files to be spanned across multiple storage media, or split into multiple files.</li>
                <li>MiniApp ZIP Containers MUST include ZIP uncompressed (method <code>0</code>, file stored) and Deflate-compressed (method <code>0</code>, lossless data compression) contents within the ZIP archive, according to the [[ZIP]] specification.</li>

            <p>The [=MiniApp ZIP Container=] is parsed by first finding the start of the ZIP Central Directory (locating the ZIP End of Central Directory record at the end of the file, then reading the start offset of the Central Directory from the record). Every MiniApp Signing Block MAY include a [=Signing Block Magic Numbers=] block, as specified in <a href="#sec-miniapp-digital-signature-requirements">Digital Signature Requirements</a>, to identify the presence of digital signatures. Once the "magic numbers" block is recognized, the [=User Agent=] would be able to process the digital signatures stored in the Signing Block, in the immediately preceding section of the Central Directory, as shown in <a href="#figure-package-references"></a>.</p>

        <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Package Integrity and Trustworthiness</h3>
            <p>To ensure the integrity and trustworthiness within the distribution stage of MiniApps, a [=MiniApp Package=] SHOULD be protected by one or more [=Digital Signatures=]. These signatures, along with certificates issued by trusted authorities, could help third parties to validate the authorship of the MiniApp (e.g. the MiniApp developer), and other entities involved in the development or distribution of the software (e.g., an application store as MiniApp distributor).</p>
            <p>The usual scenarios where digital signatures are included in MiniApps are, but not limited to:</p> 
            <ul>  
                <li>A digital signature (with a valid certificate) of the author that ensures the origin of the MiniApp, which gives a recipient strong reason to believe that this package was created by a known sender (authentication) and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity). Thus, an end-user or a hosting platform can decide whether to install the [=MiniApp Package=] depending on the status and quality of the author (e.g., credits, blocklist, certifications, etc.).</li>
                <li>Distributors’ signatures (for example, official marketplace signatures), which are used to ensure the trustworthiness of the delivery channel. This kind of signature protects end-users from tampering activities and ensures a healthy ecosystem of applications. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>No specific digital signature mechanism, cryptographic technology, or algorithm is recommended in this specification. MiniApp vendors MAY or MAY NOT implement digital signature mechanisms, according to their use cases, always following the [=MiniApp Package=] requirements.</p>

            <P>Any MiniApp may have different digital signatures, using different methods, as represented in the <a href="#figure-miniapp-signatures-example"></a>.</P>

        <h2>Signature Schemes</h2>

        <p>Every [=User Agent=] MAY support its own digital signature schemes depending on their needs. This section includes some examples of digital signature implementations supported in specific scenarios, such as developer verification and integrity of a MiniApp during its distribution.</p>   

        <section  id="sec-signature-rpk">
            <h3>RPK Signature Scheme</h3>
            <p>One of the methods of Huawei Quick App to verify the authorship of the MiniApp Package is using a whole-file digital signature based on the APK Signature Scheme v2 [[?APK_SIGNATURE_V2]]. This signature scheme was developed to increase verification speed and preserve the integrity of the protected parts of the package.</p>
            <p>Using this digital signature mechanism, every byte in the MiniApp package is involved in the signature generation. The resulting Signing Block is created and inserted into the package file, according to the <a href="sec-miniapp-digital-signature-requirements">Digital Signature Requirements</a>.</p>
            <p>The Signing Block contains ID-value pairs with information about the signature and the signer identity.</p> 
            
            <p class="note">All data values in the RPK Signing Block are represented in little-endian format, and all length-prefixed fields use <code>uint32</code> for length.</p>
            
            <p>The description  uses the following basic data types:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>uint64</dt>
                <dd>64-bit (8-byte) unsigned integer in little-endian format</dd>
                <dt>uint32</dt>
                <dd>32-bit (4-byte) unsigned integer in little-endian format</dd>
            </dl>

            <h4>Signing Block Format</h4>
            <p>The format of the RPK Signing Block is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>block size</strong> in bytes, excluding this field (uint64)</li>
                <li>Sequence of ID-value pairs (where the <a href="#sec-signing-block-signature">Signatures</a> are defined):
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>size</strong> of ID-value pair (uint64)</li> 
                        <li><strong>ID</strong> (uint32)</li>
                        <li><strong>value</strong> (size of ID-value pair - 4 bytes)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>block size</strong> in bytes (the same as first field) (uint64)</li>
                <li><strong>magic numbers</strong> “<code>RPK Sig Block 42</code>” (16 bytes)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>ID-value pairs with unknown IDs should be ignored when interpreting the block.</p>
            <p>The "block size" value enables locating the start of the signing block in the whole ZIP file.</p>

                <h5>Signatures</h5>
                <p>The signatures are stored as <strong>ID-value pairs</strong> with specific identifiers that represent the type of the signature. The supported signatures, and associated IDs, for RPK packages are the following:</p>

            <h3>PKCS#7 Signature Scheme</h3>
            <p>This signature scheme is based on the PKCS #7 Cryptographic Message Syntax [[?rfc2315]]. This method admits recursion, so one "digital envelope", the data block including encrypted content and encrypted keys, can be nested inside other. This signature scheme MAY cover also the different stages of packaging signature described in <a href="#sec-signature-rpk">RPK Signature Scheme</a>, including the developer signature and distributor signature.</p>
            <p>This signature scheme includes the provisioning profile of the MiniApp at the developer signing stage. At a second stage, a distributor MAY replace the developer's signature with the its own signature. Likely in the <a href="#sec-signature-rpk">RPK Signature Scheme</a>, this approach generates a Signing Block to be included into the package file, according to the <a href="sec-miniapp-digital-signature-requirements">Digital Signature Requirements</a>.</p>

            <p>The PKCS#7 Signing Block is defined as a data container that includes the block with the digital signature, data encrypted using the PKCS #7 syntax that contains the signatures and the signer identity.</p>
    
            
            <p>The description  uses the following basic data types:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>uint64</dt>
                <dd>64-bit (8-byte) unsigned integer</dd>
                <dt>uint32</dt>
                <dd>32-bit (4-byte) unsigned integer</dd>
                <dt>uint16</dt>
                <dd>16-bit (2-byte) unsigned integer</dd>
            </dl>

            <h4>Signing Block Format</h4>
