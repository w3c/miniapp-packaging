        <p>This specification defines semantics and conformance requirements for a [=MiniApp package=], and the structure of the single file container that holds the resources of a MiniApp, including a manifest file, static page templates, stylesheets, JavaScript documents, media files and other resources. Instances of the [=MiniApp package=] are used for MiniApp distribution and execution on runtime environments ([=MiniApp user agent=]).</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>[=MiniApp=] is a concept of light software application, that can be distributed through any digital means, and accessed through the Web. MiniApps are defined by a concrete file structure and all their resources are packed within a single file that represents the whole [=MiniApp package=] that can <a href="#dfn-process-a-miniapp-package" data-link-type="dfn">be processed</a> and executed by [=MiniApp user agents=].</p>
            <p>A [=MiniApp package=] contains a directory structure that holds the specific resources of the MiniApp that defines the rendering, operation, and interaction with the end-users — including static page templates, stylesheets, JavaScript documents, media files, and other resources — and the manifest. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/miniapp-manifest/#dfn-miniapp-manifest-s" data-link-type="dfn">MiniApp manifest</a>, located in the central directory of the package, describes the MiniApp, including information about page routing, styles, and other operational and rendering details of the MiniApp, as well as descriptive information for humans.</p>
            <p>As defined in <a href="#sec-security">Security Considerations</a>, MiniApps MAY support [=digital signature=] verification to guarantee the integrity of the package and contents during the delivery of the package.</p>
            <p>The MiniApp runtime environment ([=MiniApp user agent=]) identifies MiniApp package files through the standard [=MiniApp package=] format and the specific MIME media type, defined in this document. After retrieving the [=MiniApp ZIP container=], the [=MiniApp user agent=] loads the static page templates, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and other resources into the cache, following a <a href="#sec-miniapp-processing">dereference and processing algorithm</a>. These [=MiniApp resources=] will remain available in the cache until the next update, avoiding unnecessary network fetches.</p>
            <p>In terms of launch mode, a MiniApp can be launched normally when offline. The [=MiniApp user agent=] locates the specified [=start page=] from the package cache path and launches the MiniApp according to the description set out in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/miniapp-manifest/#dfn-miniapp-manifest-s" data-link-type="dfn">MiniApp manifest</a> file.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            This specification defines a MiniApp in logical and physical terms, detailing its <a href="#sec-conformance">internal file structure</a> and how the different <a href="#sec-miniapp-resources">resources</a> are packed within <a href="#sec-miniapp-zip-container">a single file</a>. Also, the document includes algorithms for the MiniApp user agents to <a href="#sec-miniapp-processing">retrieve and process</a> a MiniApp container.
        </p>
        <p>
            The MiniApp Packaging specification requires user agents to process the MiniApp container and its content to generate a user interface and a concrete behavior based on the <a href="#sec-filestructure">internal resources</a> (i.e., HTML, stylesheets, scripting, and others) and the configuration (i.e., manifest, app.ux). After the package fetch and processing, user agents are recommended to provide a perceivable and operable user interface and rendered content in every potential scenario, allowing the appearance adaptation to the user’s requirements using stylesheets and offering the possibility to configure and control the display options and the orientation of windows and viewports, as required by some members of the `manifest.json` ([[[MINIAPP-MANIFEST]]]).
        </p>
        <p>
            Although not specified in this document, it is recommended that user agents guarantee the accessibility aspects in the user interaction, like offering full keyboard access or supporting alternative input devices (if feasible) and enabling users to store the preference settings to improve the user experience. MiniApp user agents and platforms ought to provide mechanisms for rendering and interacting with the application, facilitating the integration of assistive technologies, and complying with applicable specifications and conventions, particularly the [[[UAAG20]]].

        <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            This specification defines a mechanism to pack, distribute and load MiniApps through a concrete configuration that specifies the app's entry point and different routes (i.e., the manifest's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/miniapp-manifest/#pages-member"  data-link-type="dfn">`pages`</a> member). [=User agents=] SHOULD mitigate the potential vulnerability during the initialization and loading phase by limiting the type of resources to be loaded and implementing a sandboxed environment that blocks access to [=powerful features=] by default.  
        </p>
        <section>
            <h3>Resources and Services</h3>
            <p>
                [=MiniApp user agents=] are vulnerable to <abbr title="Cross-Site Scripting">XSS</abbr> attacks, concretely getting and processing external resources like images, data sources, and scripts. Therefore, [=user agents=] SHOULD examine and limit the potential attack vectors and mitigate the risks by implementing a Content Security Policy (<abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr>) to control the resources that a MiniApp can fetch or execute. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A [=MiniApp package=] MAY include resources of any type, including malicious scripts. Therefore, [=MiniApp user agents=] MUST strictly limit the resources to be processed, minimizing the attack surface by discarding those not declared in the manifest and properly bound from the components. So, [=user agents=] MUST check the availability of the resources specified in the manifest (i.e., images and component pages) and the complementary files included within the container (i.e., media files, scripts, stylesheets, among others), discarding the rest of the elements in the container. Also, [=user agents=] SHOULD consider the specific risks of implementing APIs that enable using third-party resources.
            </p> 
            <p>
                The document does not require a specific exposition of information publicly. However, a [=MiniApp package=] includes features that could describe the target user agent and some characteristics of the necessary running environment, including the version of the operating system and the underlying hardware capabilities (e.g., sensors available, type of device, and kind of display). These platform requirements, specified in the MiniApp manifest, MAY halt the execution of a MiniApp initialization during the manifest processing phase, revealing some inconsistencies with the app requirements. Still, [=user agents=] SHOULD avoid the public exposition of this information to reduce the attack surface.
            </p> 
            <p>
                The MiniApp Packaging does not specify any specific mechanism to access and expose information about the underlying platform. However, [=MiniApp user agents=] MAY implement services to access this information (e.g., platform version, operating system, and sensors available) and APIs to communicate with the hardware and the operating system. Therefore, [=user agents=] SHOULD consider the potential risks when supporting these susceptible services and implement adequate mitigation mechanisms by default to guarantee that the [=powerful features=] are not activated without meaningful <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#consent">user consent</a>.

These signatures, along with certificates issued by trusted authorities, could help third parties to validate the authorship of the MiniApp (e.g., a MiniApp developer) and other entities involved in the development or distribution of the software (e.g., an application store as MiniApp distributor).
            </p>
            <p>
                The usual scenarios where digital signatures are included in MiniApps are, but are not limited to:
            </p> 
            <ul>  
                <li>
                    A [=digital signature=] (with a valid certificate) of the author that ensures the origin of the MiniApp, which gives a recipient strong reason to believe that this package was created by a known sender (authentication) and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity). Thus, an end-user or a hosting platform can decide whether to install the [=MiniApp package=] depending on the status and quality of the author (e.g., credits, blocklist, certifications, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Distributors’ signatures (for example, official marketplace signatures), which are used to ensure the trustworthiness of the delivery channel. This kind of signature protects end-users from tampering activities and provides a healthy ecosystem of applications.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                No specific [=digital signature=] mechanism, cryptographic technology, or algorithm is recommended in this specification. MiniApp vendors MAY implement digital signature mechanisms, according to their use cases. When implemented, the <a href="#sec-miniapp-digital-signature-requirements"></a> SHALL be followed.

        <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            MiniApps MAY deal with personally-identifiable information that can be persisted and preserved in the user agent's sandboxed environment for subsequent app executions. [=User agents=] MUST secure that information, allowing only instances of the same application to access the data and avoiding the public exposition. Thus, [=MiniApp user agents=] SHOULD transparently inform end-users about the type of data being collected and the purposes of the collection. 
        </p>
        <p>
            End-users MUST decide whether to remove the information stored by the user agent corresponding to any MiniApp instance. [=User agents=] SHOULD treat the stored data as potentially sensitive, ensuring that it is adequately removed from the underlying storage when deleting data. Furthermore, user agents SHOULD implement mechanisms to minimize risks in the leakage of sensitive information and protect the user's privacy, like automatically removing the stored data after long periods of inactivity. In any case, user agents SHOULD inform users transparently about the specific privacy policies implemented.
        </p>
        <p data-cite="MINIAPP-LIFECYCLE">
            A session starts when the app is [=Document/launched=] and terminates when it is [=Document/unloaded=] from the system, as defined in [[MINIAPP-LIFECYCLE]]. Although this specification does not describe any mechanism for data persistence across sessions, MiniApps MAY store data on a user's device that could be retrieved in subsequent sessions. This scenario introduces the risk of user tracking without their knowledge or control. Thus, [=MiniApp user agents=] MUST implement protections to ensure that client-side storage mechanisms cannot be misused to track users without their control, like isolating the MiniApps running environments. This isolation will allow exclusive storage space for each MiniApp, univocally identified by the manifest's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/miniapp-manifest/#app_id-member"  data-link-type="dfn">`app_id`</a> member, restricting access to the data from other MiniApps.
        </p>
        <p>
            [=User agents=] MAY offer the possibility of installing an app on the system (e.g., through home-screen shortcuts, icons on the desktop, and similar). This process SHOULD be transparent and reversible. If an end-user wants to uninstall the app, the user agent MUST ensure that all the related data is adequately removed from the underlying storage.
        </p>
        <p>
            This specification does not recommend any encryption mechanism for the [=MiniApp package=] to protect its confidentiality. However, it doesn't preclude implementing some encryption mechanism for particular purposes.

        <p>Every [=user agent=] MAY support its own digital signature schemes depending on their needs. This section includes some examples of digital signature implementations as illustrated in <a href="#figure-miniapp-signatures-example"></a>. They can be used in specific scenarios, such as developer verification and integrity of a MiniApp during its distribution.</p>

            <h3>RPK Signature Scheme</h3>
            <p>As one implementation of MiniApp, <a href="https://www.quickapp.cn/" hreflang="zh">Quick Apps</a> use a so-called RPK (Runnable Package) Signature Scheme, which is similar to the APK Signature Scheme v2 [[?APK-SIGNATURE-V2]], to verify the authorship of the [=MiniApp package=]. This signature scheme takes every byte in a MiniApp package into the signature generation. The resulting [=signing block=] is created and inserted into the package file, according to the <a href="#sec-miniapp-digital-signature-requirements">Digital Signature Requirements</a>.</p>
            <p>The [=signing block=] contains ID-value pairs with information about the signature and the signer identity.</p> 
          
             <p class="note">All data values in the RPK [=signing block=] are represented in little-endian format, and all length-prefixed fields use <code>uint32</code> for length.</p>
            
            <p>The description  uses the following basic data types:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>uint64</dt>
                <dd>64-bit (8-byte) unsigned integer in little-endian format</dd>
                <dt>uint32</dt>
                <dd>32-bit (4-byte) unsigned integer in little-endian format</dd>
            </dl>

            <h4>Signing Block Format</h4>
            <p>The format of the RPK signing block is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>block size</strong> in bytes, excluding this field (uint64)</li>
                <li>Sequence of ID-value pairs (where the <a href="#sec-signing-block-signature">Signatures</a> are defined):
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>size</strong> of ID-value pair (uint64)</li> 
                        <li><strong>ID</strong> (uint32)</li>
                        <li><strong>value</strong> (size of ID-value pair - 4 bytes)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>block size</strong> in bytes (the same as first field) (uint64)</li>
                <li><strong>magic numbers</strong> “<code>RPK Sig Block 42</code>” (16 bytes)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>ID-value pairs with unknown IDs are ignored when interpreting the block.</p>
            <p>The "block size" value enables locating the start of the signing block in the whole ZIP file.</p>

                <h5>Signatures</h5>
                <p>The signatures are stored as <strong>ID-value pairs</strong> with specific identifiers that represent the types of the signature. The supported signatures, and associated IDs, for RPK packages are described in the following sub-clauses.</p>
                
                <p class="ednote" title="package-splitting"> There are cases where a MiniApp package is split into multiple sub-packages (by a distribution platform e.g. an app-store) for the user agent to download and execute it in a progressive fashion to improve the user experience. In such a case, additional signature types (thus IDs) would be needed to ensure the integrity of each sub-package as well as the whole. Details are for further study.</p>

            <h3>PKCS#7 Signature Scheme</h3>
            <p>This signature scheme is based on the PKCS #7 Cryptographic Message Syntax [[?rfc2315]]. It MAY cover different stages of packaging signature described in <a href="#sec-signature-rpk">RPK Signature Scheme</a>, including the developer signature and distributor signature.</p>
            <p>This signature scheme includes the [=Provisioning Profile=] of the MiniApp and the developer's signature at the first stage (developer signing stage). At the second stage (distributor signing stage), a distributor MAY replace the developer's signature with the its own signature. Like the <a href="#sec-signature-rpk">RPK Signature Scheme</a>, this approach generates a signing block to be included into the package file, according to the <a href="#sec-miniapp-digital-signature-requirements">Digital Signature Requirements</a>.</p>

            <p>The PKCS#7 signing block is defined as a data container that includes the block with the digital signature, data encrypted using the PKCS #7 syntax that contains the signatures and the signer identity.</p>
    
            
            <p>The description  uses the following basic data types:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>uint64</dt>
                <dd>64-bit (8-byte) unsigned integer</dd>
                <dt>uint32</dt>
                <dd>32-bit (4-byte) unsigned integer</dd>
                <dt>uint16</dt>
                <dd>16-bit (2-byte) unsigned integer</dd>
            </dl>

            <h4>Signing Block Format</h4>
            <p>The format of the PKCS#7 signing block is as follows:</p>

        <h2>Media Type Registration</h2>
        <p>This appendix registers the <code>application/miniapp-pkg+zip</code> media type for MiniApp packages, in conformance with BCP 13 [[RFC4289]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/01/registering-mediatypes.html">Register an Internet Media Type for a W3C Spec</a>.</p>

        <p>A [=MiniApp package=] file is a container technology based on the [[ZIP]] archive format, including some modifications.</p>

            <dt>Encoding considerations:</dt>
            <dd>MiniApp packages are binary files encoded in the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/zip">application/zip</a> media type. See <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6839#section-3.6">RFC 6839, section 3.6</a> [[RFC6839]].</dd>
            <dt>Security considerations:</dt>
            <dd>Security considerations that apply to application/zip also apply to MiniApp package files. User agents that process MiniApp package files should rigorously check the size and validity of data retrieved. When digital signatures are available in a MiniApp package file, the user agent SHOULD implement necessary mechanisms to check the integrity and trustworthiness of the file according to the digital signatures, so as to to protect the end user and the hosting platform from the damage of package tampering or corruption. See more at [[[#sec-security]]].</dd>
            <dt>Interoperability considerations:</dt>
            <dd>The file, after including the signature, is not a standard ZIP but the inclusion does not affect parsing and operation of the file as a ZIP file.</dd>
            <dt>Published specification:</dt>
            <dd>This media type registration is for the MiniApp package, as described in the specification located at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/miniapp-packaging/">https://www.w3.org/TR/miniapp-packaging/</a>.</dd>
            <dt>Applications that use this media type:</dt>
            <dd>This media type is used for the distribution of MiniApps. The list, non exhaustive, of applications and software platforms that (intend to) support this media type are:

                The listed applications above are the base technologies to develop this spec. They are not using the proposed media type yet, but will potentially support it when the spec is ready. The list will be confirmed/updated later.
